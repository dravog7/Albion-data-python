# Albion Data Python

A simple wrapper for the [Albion Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/) API

## Install

Install using pip

```bash
    python3 -m pip install albion-data
```

## Features

- check price of items

```python
# price of t4 and t5 bag at lymhurst quality 1
from albion_data import get_price
get_price(["T4_BAG","T5_BAG"],"Lymhurst",1)
```

- check history of item

```python
#get daily history of t4 bag at lymhurst of quality 1
from albion_data import get_history
get_history("T4_BAG","Lymhurst",1,time_scale=24)
```

- System for making arithemetic expressions

The values are lazy loaded.

```python
#check if t4 leather refining is profitable in fort sterling without focus
from albion_data import Var
t4leather = Var("T4_LEATHER","Fort Sterling","sell_price_min")
t4hide = Var("T4_HIDE","Fort Sterling","sell_price_min")
t3leather = Var("T3_LEATHER","Fort Sterling","sell_price_min")
if (2 * t4hide + t3leather) < t4leather: #triggers a single API call
    print("refine t4hide")
else:
    print("not worth it")
```

## NOTES

- The item ids and market names can be found [here](https://github.com/broderickhyman/ao-bin-dumps/tree/master/formatted)

- Use &,|,~ for logical and,or,not when making arithemetic expressions with Var. [why not and,or,not?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32311518/is-it-possible-to-overload-logical-and-in-python)

- the PYPI name of package and all API might change until v1
